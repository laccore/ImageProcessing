<p><em>March 14, 2019</em><br />
<em>version 1.1</em></p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>LacCore/CSDCO XRF Converter is a software utility developed by <a href="https://csdco.umn.edu">LacCore/CSDCO</a> to prepare core imagery generated by XRF and X-radiographic core scanners for viewing and use in applications like the visualization tool <a href="https://csdco.umn.edu/resources/software/corelyzer">Corelyzer</a>.</p>
<p>The Converter was developed to replace a collection of Photoshop scripts. It is free, available for Windows and macOS/OSX, written in <a href="https://python.org">Python</a>, and leans heavily on the <a href="https://python-pillow.org/">Pillow</a> imaging library. Source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/laccore/ImageProcessing">GitHub</a>.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>For each horizontally-oriented radiograph image processed, the Converter:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Adds a ruler to the bottom of the image</li>
<li>Performs gamma correction with a user-defined value to enhance image contrast</li>
<li>Creates a JPEG of the resulting image</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="preparing-to-use-the-converter">Preparing to Use the Converter</h2>
<p>The Converter expects that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Images to be processed are horizontally-oriented, with the core top at the top of the image</li>
<li>Ruler images are horizontally-oriented, with values increasing from left to right</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to ensure the resolution of the ruler image matches the resolution of the image(s) being processed or the scale will be inaccurate. The application provides a single grayscale ruler image with resolution 508 dots per inch (DPI), or 20 pixels per millimeter (ppmm).</p>
<p>If your core imagery isn't 508 DPI/20 ppmm, you'll need to provide your own ruler image(s). We created our ruler image by scanning a physical ruler on our linescan imager, and suggest you do the same. Alternately, you can use an image editing tool like Photoshop or (free and open-source) <a href="https://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a> to resize the provided ruler as needed. For instance, if you need a 254 DPI ruler, resize the provided 508 DPI ruler to 50% (508 dots/inch * 0.5 = 254 dots/inch) of its original size.</p>
<p>To make your ruler images available in the Converter, place them in the &quot;rulers&quot; folder alongside the Converter application, then restart the Converter if it's currently running. Your ruler images should now be available in the Ruler dropdown menu.</p>

<p>There is no limit to the number of ruler images that can be added.</p>
<h2 id="main-window">Main Window</h2>
<p>The application consists of a single window.<br />

<h2 id="adding-images-and-specifying-processing-options">Adding Images and Specifying Processing Options</h2>
<p>First, add one or more radiograph images to be processed. Images can be selected via the &quot;Add&quot; button, or by dragging and dropping files into the &quot;Images to be converted&quot; list. Next, specify desired processing options. A description of each option follows:</p>
<p><strong>Gamma Correction</strong><br />
A gamma correction value greater than zero. Smaller values result in darker imagery, larger values brighter. We suggest starting with a value around 1.5 and making adjustments based on your desired brightness and contrast. Typically, gamma correction values below 0.8 produce a dark, insufficiently-contrasting image. Similarly, values above 2.3 usually produce a bright, insufficiently-contrasting image. But of course you're free to use any value that yields satisfactory results!</p>

<p><strong>Ruler</strong><br />
A list of the ruler images in the &quot;rulers&quot; directory. The selected ruler image will be added to the bottom of the core image.</p>
<p><strong>Output Naming</strong><br />
Output images can be named in one of two ways:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Use input file's name. Each output image will have the same filename as the input image file.</li>
<li>Use name of input file's parent directory. Each output image will have the same name as the input image's parent directory.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Save Settings as Default</strong><br />
You can save the current set of options by clicking the &quot;Save Settings as Default&quot; button. They will be restored the next time the Converter is launched.</p>
<h2 id="processing-images">Processing Images</h2>
<p>Now that your options are set, you can process your images! To do so, click the &quot;Convert Images&quot; button. A progress bar will be displayed during conversion, and a message will be displayed when conversion is complete.</p>
<p><strong>Output File Location</strong><br />
The Converter creates a directory called &quot;radiograph&quot; alongside the application where it places output files.</p>
